<p><span style="color: black;">Formed
in 1973 by five Juilliard graduates, </span><b><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">THE AULOS ENSEMBLE</span></b><span style="color: black;"> was at
the forefront of a movement that was to capture the imagination of the American
listening public. In 1978 with the release of their recording, </span><b><i><span style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">"Masterpieces of the High Baroque"</span></i></b><span style="color: black;">, </span><b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">
AULOS</span></b><span style="color: black;">' reputation for exhilarating performances informed with
scholarly insight was firmly established. In those groundbreaking years, the
group's innovative programming featured a blend of flute, oboe, violin, cello,
and harpsichord, later adding a viola da gamba. <span>&nbsp;</span>With its conservatory based training, Aulos
brought an uncompromising standard of excellence in performance that resulted
in invitations from virtually all of this country's major chamber music
presenters. This exposure helped create a new audience awareness for the rich
rewards of this repertoire performed on "period instruments" and
comments such as "scintillating", "virtuosic", and
"authentic baroque performance at its best" from America's most
respected music critics. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: black;">In the 1980's, </span><b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS</span></b><span style="color: black;"> began two projects that brought the joy of its
music-making to an ever- widening public and for the first time attracted
international critical attention. The group's first recording for the Musical
Heritage Society, </span><b><i><span style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">"Original
Telemann"</span></i></b><span style="color: black;"> was released in 1981 in
connection with the composer's tercentenary, and was universally hailed as one
of the most accomplished and significant observances of the Telemann year,
receiving the "Critic's Choice" award of High Fidelity/Musical
America Magazine. Since then, the Ensemble has released over a dozen CDs on the
same label, including 2- CD sets of Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi, as well as the
complete </span><b><i><span style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">"Essercizii Musici"</span></i></b><span style="color: black;"> of Telemann on 5 CDs. This discography is unique among
American "period-instrument" chamber groups. </span></p>

<p><b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS</span></b><span style="color: black;">' other project
in the '80s was the establishment of its own concert series at home in New York City. This series
featured collaborations with guest artists from Europe and America who had made major
reputations in this field. These collaborative concerts, exploring a highly
unusual repertoire that was impossible to perform in other contexts, provided
its New York
audiences with cutting edge performances as well as giving the Ensemble members
vital artistic stimulation. Among the stars of the "original instrument"
movement that appeared with the Ensemble in those years were harpsichordists
Trevor Pinnock and Albert Fuller, violinists Jaap Schroeder and Stanley
Ritchie, cellist Anner Bylsma, oboist Michel Piguet, and vocalists Jan de
Gaetani, Bethany Beardslee, Charles Bressler, and Julianne Baird. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: black;">The
1980's also saw the beginnings of what has become a wonderful tradition for New York
concertgoers--the </span><b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS</span></b><span style="color: black;"> "Christmas Concerts" in front of the Neapolitan
Christmas Tree at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. These concerts, described by
the New York Times as "one of the most charming musical celebrations of
the season" have been given annually in the magical setting of the Medieval Sculpture Court
and have featured a variety of guest artists. A recording of one such program,
entitled </span><b><i><span style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">"A Baroque
Christmas"</span></i></b><span style="color: black;"> and featuring the
soprano, Julianne Baird, was recorded for MHS/ Musicmasters and is available to
millions of people throughout the world through the Metropolitan Museum
Catalogue. The popularity of these concerts and the recording encouraged </span><b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS</span></b><span style="color: black;"> to begin to
offer them on tour, bringing the special affinity of this repertoire and the
seasonal festivities to audiences throughout the country. <span>&nbsp;</span>Over the past seasons the eminent American vocalists
Dawn Upshaw, Sanford Sylvan, and Derek Lee Ragin are some of the artists who
have appeared with </span><b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS</span></b><span style="color: black;"> in these presentations. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: black;">In the 1990's </span><b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS</span></b><span style="color: black;"> began expanding its repertoire to include "one on a
part" performances of some of the best known and favorite baroque Suites
and Concerti, including the Bach </span><b><i><span style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">5th
Brandenburg Concerto</span></i></b><span style="color: black;"> and the </span><b><i><span style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">Concerto for Oboe and Violin</span></i></b><span style="color: black;"> as well as Vivaldi's concerti
</span><b><i><span style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">The Four Seasons</span></i></b><span style="color: black;">.
These programs, referred to as </span><b><i><span style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">"The
Baroque Big Band"</span></i></b><span style="color: black;">, are performed
with from 8 to 10 artists. An all-Bach CD, part of the continuing discography
on MHS, features the Ensemble in this configuration. Additionally, </span><b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS</span></b><span style="color: black;"> began giving
numerous master classes and lecture-demonstrations in 17th and 18th-century
performance practice at colleges and universities throughout the country. With
its members serving on faculties of various schools of music and institutes
specializing in historically informed performance, the Ensemble is responsible
for training a new generation of American early music performers. </span><b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS</span></b><span style="color: black;"> concerts are
frequently broadcast by National Public Radio from venues such as The Frick
Collection in New York, Live at WolfTrap, and
the Library of Congress in Washington,
 D.C. <span>&nbsp;</span>Most recently, its instrumental Christmas
program, </span><b><i><span style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">"Joyeux Noel"</span></i></b><span style="color: black;"> was heard throughout the country repeatedly on NPR's
"Performance Today</span><span style="color: black;">"<span>.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: black;">Now, in its 4<sup>th</sup> decade, </span><b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS</span></b><span style="color: black;"> continues to explore new projects and develop outlets for its
music-making.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 2006-7 season saw its
first presentation of Handel's masque <b><i style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">Acis and Galatea</i></b>, done in a version
approximating the size of the composer's vision for the piece&mdash;5 singers and 8
instrumentalists without a conductor&mdash;and it was a huge hit with presenters, audiences
and critics.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <b>New York Times </b>wrote "In all, it was an utter delight". <span>&nbsp;</span>The Ensemble has developed a true chamber
orchestra program as well, featuring Handel's complete <b><i style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">Water Music</i> </b>in a
performance with between 17 and 23 players.<span>&nbsp;

</span>Where appropriate, </span><b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS</span></b><span style="color: black;"> has created residencies in which the
group and its guests teach and coach young professionals and then join them in
these performances.<span>&nbsp; </span>And 15 years after
the release of their Christmas CD from the Metropolitan Museum,
the Ensemble and Julianne Baird collaborated on <b><i style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">In Dulci Jubilo</i></b>, a recording
featuring much of <span>&nbsp;</span>the new material
uncovered in those many years of Christmas concerts.<span>&nbsp; </span>This CD was released in the fall of 2006 to
critical acclaim, and was the beginning of a new series of recordings for Centaur Records.
It was followed in 2008 by <b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS'</span></b> unique version of two of Rameau's
wonderful opera suites from <b><i style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">Les Indes Galantes </i></b>and <b><i style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">Les
F&ecirc;tes d'h&eacute;b&eacute;</i></b>, based
on suggestions by the composer in 'short-score' manuscripts&mdash;the first
recording ever done in this chamber ensemble setting. Most recently, the
Ensemble released <b><i style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">"The Bach Family Album"</i></b> which the American Record
Guide described as "enthralling".</span></p>
<p>In 2014-15 <b><span style="color: rgb(116, 0, 0);">AULOS</span></b> is celebrating its 40th anniversary and continues to offer new collaborations and programs. Dominique Labelle is featured as a guest in its latest Centaur release: <b><i style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">"The Handel Album"</i></b>  (2014) and Sherezade Panthaki sang <b><i style="color: rgb(16, 0, 153);">"If Music be the Food of Love..."</i></b> with the Ensemble for the first time last season.</p>
