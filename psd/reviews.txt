"Authentic Baroque performance at its best."
The New York Times

"The performances were by far the most exhilarating
examples of Baroque playing that these ears have heard."
The San Francisco Examiner

"The Aulos Ensemble's playing is so untroubled and brilliant,
so perfect, so absolute! It is the highest level of musicmaking."
Alte Musik Aktuell
(Regensburg, Germany)

"If it has to be just one Christmas concert, this is it!"
The New York Times

"The Aulos Ensemble's recording has me scurrying for superlatives. What can I say?
The music is wonderful;  the scholarship exemplary;  the performances distinguished."
Fanfare

"The Aulos Ensemble at its best produced utterly compelling results.
The poise and fantasy in the Largo of Vivaldi's Concerto in G minor
was one of those magical moments that makes concert-going a worthy adventure."
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette



"This work {Acis and Galatea} is a little gem and Aulos polished it to a high luster.
The Aulos players were their usual expert selves. In all, it was an utter delight."
The New York Times

"The Aulos Ensemble have produced in this recording one of the most elegant and
delightful collections of Christmas music to have graced my stereo system in some years.
Beautifully programmed and masterfully played, this is a disc of rather constant delights."
MusicWeb International

"The result is something quite new and powerful. The performers exhibit a masterfully controlled sense of ensemble throughout, and their precisely articulated delivery breathes with Rameau's subtly dramatic phrasal undulations. The effect is exquisite."
